When I was 20 years old, I join my first match, I am not good at English, so my README.md looks like a student's compostition who is in primary school, but I still want to write it in English, I didn't go to high school , but i still want to learn English, because i like coding...


# backgroud

I like coding, so i join the game, i make a lot of friends , i am very happy, i will learn in FreeCodeCamp when i was free;

# theme
 
**/D3** in this folder, there is the project about D3, this is my first time to make report by D3.js , it is intersting, it likes echart, but is it stronger than echart ?...

**/HTML_CSS_Project & /js** in those folder , something about the base project, i dont have much time , so maybe my first commit is no good.... i will optimize in the feature...

**/nodejs** my first time to write backstage, it is amazing , mybe my code is very bad, but i think i will learn it very good in the feature;

**/react** it makes me to write little game very fast, it is powerful, the file i push can not be run, it run at codepen , i Ctrl+C into my computer , but i write it by myself.
